"Micro-Activities:
1) List of activites that are typically half-an-hour to two hours in duration; include relevant facts & details.
2) Ensure that you make a log entry at least every two hours.
3)  If a task takes many hours, break up the activies into multiple log entries. Each log entry should describe your accomplishments for time blocks of approximately two hours.",,,,,,,

,0049,31/Jan/26,4:30 PM,6:00 PM,,"DP1.0 review: Looked over the DP1.0 report outline and checked whether all required sections are present (intro, baseline, candidates, conclusion). Cross-examined the planned comparison approach (speed vs cost) against a couple online references to confirm what metrics are normally reported (timing/Fmax + resource utilization).",1.50
,0049,31/Jan/26,6:00 PM,7:30 PM,,Online cross-check: Used YouTube and Google Scholar to sanity-check carry-save vs ripple adder tradeoffs (area vs speed) and how FPGA results are typically presented. Wrote brief bullet notes for what screenshots/tables should support the final write-up (RTL/Technology Viewer + timing/resource summaries).,1.50
,0049,31/Jan/26,7:30 PM,8:00 PM,,"Wrap-up: Re-read the outline to ensure the planned evidence and comparisons are consistent. Consolidated research notes into a short checklist of items to verify later during implementation/testing (metrics, figures, and citations).",0.50
